## About
PersonalAccountant has the objective of making keeping track of your personal spending easier.

The idea behind it is to allow the user to take a picture an receipt and the app keeps record of the picture and the amount spent. It will also allow the user to separate the receipt into different categories so different budgets can be given to each category.


**Planed Features include:**
* Automatic detection of total cost in receipts
* Customizable categories
* Over budget warnings
* Export to other devices
